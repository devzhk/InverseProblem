# Code from https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/qml/blob/master/demonstrations/tutorial_classical_shadows.py
# A classical shadow is a collection of :math:`N` individual snapshots :math:`\hat{\rho}_i`.
# Each snapshot is obtained with the following procedure:
#
# 1. The quantum state :math:`\rho` is prepared with a circuit.
# 2. A unitary :math:`U` is randomly selected from the ensemble and applied to :math:`\rho`.
# 3. A computational basis measurement is performed.
# 4. The snapshot is recorded as the observed eigenvalue :math:`1,-1` for :math:`|0\rangle,|1\rangle`, respectively, and the index of the randomly selected unitary :math:`U`.
#
# To obtain a classical shadow using PennyLane, we design the ``calculate_classical_shadow``
# function below.
# This function obtains a classical shadow for the state prepared by an input 
# ``circuit_template``.
